Face Morph- Final Year Project:
My Birmingham Masters project. See the READ ME file in this folder for instructions on how to run the program. This folder also contains the project report. 

OpenGL Fireworks Project:
Hard-coded a real-time fireworks simulation program through C++ and OpenGL. Constructed through a transform feedback loop running through the vertex and fragment shaders, the program will generate a series of fully animated fireworks of a random size, position, and color at the push of the spacebar.
